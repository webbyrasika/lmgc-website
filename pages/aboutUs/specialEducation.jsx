                        At La Martinière Girls’ College, Special Education &amp;
                        Counselling sessions provide students with identified
                        disabilities specialised instruction designed to meet
                        their unique learning needs, allowing them to develop to
                        their fullest potential. It is a purposeful intervention
                        (preventative, remedial or compensatory) designed to
                        overcome or eliminate the obstacles that keep children
                        with disabilities from learning. Some children with
                        disabilities require special accommodations to achieve
                        success while other children must be taught skills to
                        compensate for the existence of a disability. We believe
                        that students flourish when given the tools for success
                        within a caring environment.

                        In 2006, Late Mrs Farida Abraham launched the Special
                        Education Unit (SEU). Her vision was to build an
                        environment where children who cannot learn in the
                        conventional way, have an opportunity to maximise their
                        potential. Her mission was to provide specific
                        tailor-made techniques for individual success.
                        Additionally, trained counsellors would offer a
                        therapeutic educational environment designed to meet the
                        needs of students with emotional disturbance, specific
                        learning difficulties, slow learners, motor coordination
                        issues, sensorial deficits, psychological issues,
                        physical handicaps and other disabilities that may
                        affect their behaviour or academic success in the school
                        setting.

                      The SEU believes that help provided at early or middle
                      academic stages has the maximum impact for lasting
                      success. A formal assessment is used for early
                      identification to ensure that the child receives academic
                      benefits and subject concessions within Council
                      guidelines. Early intervention strategies include liaising
                      with classroom teachers and parents to provide customized
                      help to the child. The techniques involved in teaching and
                      the concessions provided to the children are
                      individualized. The goal is to provide maximum support up
                      to classes VI and VII. By class VIII, the support is
                      gradually withdrawn so that by the time the child
                      transitions to senior school, she can apply the learning
                      techniques independently to manage a full load of ICSE
                      standards for all academic areas.

                        effective communication as an important social skill.
                        Frequent workshops and talks are conducted on topics
                        such as anger management, effective communication,
                        handling stress, memorising techniques etc. Each student
                        has a distinct persona that can be developed, polished
                        and refined. With counselling, the students’ outer and
                        inner self is enhanced and groomed to bring about a
                        positive and lasting change in their lives.
