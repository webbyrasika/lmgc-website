                  An independent girls’ school, La Martiniere Girls' College
                  prepares young women to be self-directed learners and
                  confident leaders. Outside of the classroom, our girls are
                  leaders in every corner of the campus. They never take the
                  back seat and ensure to leave a mark wherever they go. Our
                  girls have learnt the fine art of entrepreneurship and use it
                  for the betterment, and enhancement of society and for the
                  service of humanity. The students learn to become dauntless
                  and self-reliant and never forget to light the lamps of those
                  who don’t have a match.

                      baking for a school event for 2000 people, She has grown
                      the revenue of her business by 80% in just the past year
                      itself while managing her board exams simultaneously.
                      Societies, events, residential spaces, orders from all
                      areas of Lucknow, her passion to bake is slowly turning
