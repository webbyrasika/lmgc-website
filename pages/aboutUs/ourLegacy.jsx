                          The Founder, Major General Claude Martin (5th January
                          1735 – 13th September 1800) was an officer in the
                          French, and later the British army in India. He rose
                          to the position of Major General in the British East
                          India Company's Bengal Army. Born in Lyon, France, he
                          came from a humble background. He was a self-made man
                          who left a substantial legacy in the form of his
                          writings, buildings and educational institutions that
                          he founded posthumously.

                          Claude Martin left the greater part of his wealth to a
                          variety of charities. Being almost entirely
                          self-educated, he realised the value of formal
                          education and set aside a vast portion of his estate
                          for the founding of schools at Kolkata, Lucknow and
                          Lyon (France), the city of his birth. These schools
                          play a major role in training the youth of today to
                          become educated, disciplined and useful citizens of
                          the world. Thousands who have passed through these
                          schools are deeply grateful for Claude Martin’s
                          generosity and foresight. The schools celebrate
                          Founder's Day on 13th September, the anniversary of
                          Claude Martin's death.

                          Unfortunately, Claude Martin has been largely ignored
                          by history. Lesser people find a place in history, but
                          historians seem to have neglected the man whose palace
                          dominated the skyscape of Awadh. They overlooked that
                          he was a brave soldier who always came forward to
                          render military service and ultimately rose to the
                          rank of Major-General (though honorary) at a time when
                          foreigners did not rise above the rank of Major. His
                          services as a surveyor of places like Undwanala,
                          Chunargarh, the Course of the River Teesta, and Cooch
                          Bihar were invaluable. The Nawabs of Awadh
                          acknowledged Claude Martin as a great architect and
                          had many of their buildings designed by him. He was
                          the trusted confidante of the Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, who
                          saw in him a genius, essential to offset Company
                          influence. The Company needed him, otherwise, he could
                          not have lasted in their service for so long
                          (1763-1800 A.D.).
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-justify mb-5">
                          As a diplomat he was exemplary. He walked the tight
                          rope between the Nawab and the Company with such
                          astuteness that both needed his services till the end.
                          He was a money-lender and banker who was trusted more
                          than the Company or the Nawabs. Such credibility
                          ensured that a shrewd businessman like him could turn
                          all his ventures into profitable enterprises.

                          He was a man of fine taste who gave Lucknow many of
                          its famous historical buildings. He was a man who left
                          his wealth for the children and people of the country
                          which had become his home for better or for worse. He
                          will remain alive in the hearts of students who will
                          sing his constant praises. The three schools at
                          Lucknow, Kolkata and Lyons stand testimony to the
                          sincerity of his intent – they are his most permanent
                          and eloquent monuments. No history of Lucknow can be
                          complete without a mention of Claude Martin. He is
                          entitled to a place of honour for his role in the
                          promotion of education in India and his hometown,
